# coding test

Hi :) 

npm install

npm run dev

## Motivation

As recommended by the tasks, I used React, Next.js

I used Redux-Thunk to make it easier for me to pass information between components. It enables faster work and allows separation of code.

I decided to use only reack hooks because of their simplicity. And I just like them :)

**Unfortunately, I have other responsibilities and I could not devote enough time to complete the task. I didn't manage to write the tests. I present links to repos that contain tests: **
